# GreedyAlgoPractice
Finds the possible spanning trees using Kruskal's Algorithm. This was my final project for "Introduction to Modeling and Optimization" class. The only issue is that it displays some duplicates, might update it later.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kruskals-minimum-spanning-tree-algorithm-greedy-algo-2/ for the explanation. If we change the weights of the nodes to 1 or an equal amount,
finding the total number of min spanning trees basically becomes finding the total number of spanning trees(It also shows the trees one by one).
